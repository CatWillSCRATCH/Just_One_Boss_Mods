Hello! I made this mod on the 23rd, but I decided to release it on Christmas!

Modifications:

- Player changed to red
- Throwing cards changed to stockings
- Flowers changed to Christmas trees
- Coins changed to snowflakes
- Hearts changed to peppermints
- Top hat changed to Santa's hat
- Bunnies changed to reindeer and the carrot is changed to a candy cane
- The magic tile is changed to 2 color-changing candy canes
- Changed the title screen and the ending credits screen

There is a texture in the game that is a blue square with a question mark!
If you find it, tell me in the Issues tab and tell me where you found it.

GL, HF, and Merry Christmas!
